# SudokuSolver
Sudoku solver in Haskell

**Language: Haskell**

**Start: 2014**

## Why
I read [Real World Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_World_Haskell) and started working with Haskell. I decide to work on a "Sudoku solver" because I needed a real problem to apply _functional programming_ to.
